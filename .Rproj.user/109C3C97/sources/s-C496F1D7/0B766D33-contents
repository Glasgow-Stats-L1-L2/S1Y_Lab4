This is the Forensic Case Study Lab.
As you work through the different sections, you will be asked some multiple-choice questions, run example code and also write your own code. After you finish the sections *Value of Evidence Example* and *PCR testing (COVID-19)*, you are asked to complete a Group Exercise. 

 
In this tutorial, you will:

* compute posterior probabilities of the form $P(H_{p}|E)$ from prior probabilities $P(H_{p})$, using odds and the value of evidence.
* write a function that computes a conditional probability using Bayes' theorem.  
* investigate the effects of sensitivity, specificity and base rate on test results.


Before you start your work in RStudio, make sure you have the following packages loaded: 


```{r load-packages, eval = FALSE}
#load them at the start of each session
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

<!-- #you only need to install them once -->
<!-- install.packages("dplyr") -->
<!-- install.packages("ggplot2") -->
