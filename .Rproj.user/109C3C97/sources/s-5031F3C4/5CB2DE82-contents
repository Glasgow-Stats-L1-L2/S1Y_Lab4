## Group Tasks

### Sampling Distributions

#### Task 1

Take a sample of size 20 from the population you created in Part 1 and calculate the proportion of people in this sample who think the work scientists do  **does** enhance their lives. Using this sample, state the point estimate of the population proportion of people who think the work scientists do enhance their lives?

```{r group1, eval = FALSE}
sample <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(20)

sample %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n))
```

#### Task 2

Take 2000 samples of size 20 from the population and compute 2000 sample proportions for those who think the work scientists do enhance their lives. Store these proportions as `sample_props20`. Plot the data as a histogram.

```{r group2, eval = TRUE, out.width='72%'}
sample_props20 <- global_monitor %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 20, reps = 2000, replace = TRUE) %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n)) %>%
  filter(scientist_work == "Benefits")

ggplot(data = sample_props20, aes(x = p_hat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, fill = "seagreen3")
```

**Is there any skew in this sampling distribution?**

a)  Yes, the data are left skewed

#### Task 3

Change your sample size from 20 to 200 and calculate each sample proportion using the same method as above. Store these proportions in a new object called `sample_props200`. Then, plot the sampling distribution as a histogram.

```{r group3, eval = TRUE, out.width='72%'}
sample_props200 <- global_monitor %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 200, reps = 2000, replace = TRUE) %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n)) %>%
  filter(scientist_work == "Benefits")

ggplot(data = sample_props200, aes(x = p_hat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, fill = "seagreen3")
```

**What value would you use to estimate the true population proportion from the sampling distribution from *Task 3*?**

b)  The mean of the sample proportions

**Of the sampling distributions from 2 and 3, which has a smaller spread?**

b)  Sampling distribution from Q3

### Confidence Intervals

#### Task 4

Returning now to the context and data in Part 2, take a sample of size 60 from `us_adults` and calculate a confidence interval for the proportion of US Adults who think climate change is affecting their local community with a confidence level of 90% and interpret it.

```{r group4, eval=TRUE}
sample <- us_adults %>%
  sample_n(60)

sample_pro <- proportions(table(sample))
sample_pro <- sample_pro[2]

sample_se <- sqrt(sample_pro * (1 - sample_pro) / 60)

lower_vector <- sample_pro - 1.64 * sample_se / sqrt(60) 
upper_vector <- sample_pro + 1.64 * sample_se / sqrt(60)

ci <- c(lower_vector, upper_vector)
ci
```

**Is this interval narrower or wider than the confidence interval for the proportion of US Adults who think climate change is affecting their local community calculated earlier at a 95% confidence level?**

a)  narrower
