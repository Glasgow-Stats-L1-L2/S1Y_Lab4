In this lab we investigate the ways in which sample statistics calculated from a random sample of data can serve as point estimates for population parameters.  We're 
interested in formulating a *sampling distribution* of our point estimate in order 
to learn about the properties of the estimate, such as its shape, centre and spread. From that distribution we can calculate *confidence intervals* as interval estimates for the unknown population parameters.

The material within this lab has been based on OpenLearn Chapter 5
